# Guiding Lights for writing code
1. Correctness - Does your code do what it's supposed to correctly?
2. Design - Qualitative measure to assess how well-written the code is, e.g., DRY and efficient.
3. Style - Aesthetics of the code; analogous to using proper punctuation and capitalizing of text to improve readibility.

# CS50 IDE
- ide.cs50.io

# Execute code using CLI
- What is between my source code and my machine code? The compiler!
- Use "make hello" to compile hello.c

# Function and Arguments
- Argument - an input that is used by a function to perform something

# Side Effects
- Often something visual that happens on the screen. E.g., the Scratch sprite moving or displaying a message

# Return values, variables
- Something a function passes back after executing the code within. Often, what is returned is stored in a variable.
- C is a lot more pedantic than Scratch so you have to assign things yourself.

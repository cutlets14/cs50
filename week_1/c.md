# Guiding Lights for writing code
1. Correctness - Does your code do what it's supposed to correctly?
2. Design - Qualitative measure to assess how well-written the code is, e.g., DRY and efficient.
3. Style - Aesthetics of the code; analogous to using proper punctuation and capitalizing of text to improve readibility.

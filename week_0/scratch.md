# Binary Number System
- Binary number
    - A number expressed in the base-2 numeral system which uses only two symbols: 0 and 1
    - Each digit is referred to as a bit (binary digit)
- Why do computers think in binary?
    - The physical input to computers is electricity so when we want to store electricity, we call it 1 and when we want to "let go" of electricity, we can call it 0.
- How do we count greater than 1?
    - We use more bits!
    - E.g., 110010 = 50 i.e., (1)(2^5) + (1)(2^4) + (0)(2^3) + (0)(2^2) + (1)(2^1) + (0)(2^0)
